"""
Wayfinder's own session state - deliberately plain, deliberately separate
from mem0_backend.py/chat_cache.py/customer_record.py. Those exist for
ordinary WhatsApp conversation (fact extraction, rolling-window recent
turns, business-defined profile fields) and none of them model "pick this
customer's intake back up, with everything that's happened so far" the
way Wayfinder needs - see this session's own finding that no resumable
session object exists anywhere in this mesh yet.

Two plain Mongo collections, keyed by phone (E.164, as given):

  wayfinder_chat_turns   - one document per turn, append-only
  wayfinder_uploads      - already written by upload_links.py (piece B) -
                           this module only reads it back

build_state() marries (1) chat history and (2) the text already
extracted from that customer's uploaded documents - but a raw
concatenation of both just hands the next prompt a wall of text to
re-interpret from scratch every single call. The actual "marriage" is
infer_profile(): one LLM call that reads both and distills them into
the structured fields Wayfinder's intake actually tracks (preferences,
family/leave info, a budget signal, what's still missing) - so every
other skill reads a settled judgment, not raw material it has to
re-derive itself each time. Before this, nothing stitched those two
together at all - get_context_documents() was the missing retrieval
tool, infer_profile() is the missing inference step.
