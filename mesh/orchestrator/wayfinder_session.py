"""
Wayfinder's own session state - deliberately plain, deliberately separate
from mem0_backend.py/chat_cache.py/customer_record.py. Those exist for
ordinary WhatsApp conversation (fact extraction, rolling-window recent
turns, business-defined profile fields) and none of them model "pick this
customer's intake back up, with everything that's happened so far" the
way Wayfinder needs - see this session's own finding that no resumable
session object exists anywhere in this mesh yet.

Two plain Mongo collections, keyed by phone (E.164, as given):

  wayfinder_chat_turns   - one document per turn, append-only
  wayfinder_uploads      - already written by upload_links.py (piece B) -
                           this module only reads it back

build_state() marries (1) chat history and (2) the text already
extracted from that customer's uploaded documents - but a raw
concatenation of both just hands the next prompt a wall of text to
re-interpret from scratch every single call. The actual "marriage" is
infer_profile(): one LLM call that reads both and distills them into
the structured fields Wayfinder's intake actually tracks (preferences,
family/leave info, a budget signal, what's still missing) - so every
other skill reads a settled judgment, not raw material it has to
re-derive itself each time. Before this, nothing stitched those two
together at all - get_context_documents() was the missing retrieval
tool, infer_profile() is the missing inference step.

Distill this into the customer's current profile. Only state what's actually supported by the text below - leave a field empty/null rather than guessing. For budget_signal, ground it in the uploaded statement text if present; don't invent a number. For origin_city, destination_hint, and travel_window, only fill these in if a specific city/place/date was actually stated - a mood or style ("beaches", "somewhere relaxing") is a preference, not a destination. Set destination_flexible=true ONLY when the customer explicitly invites Wayfinder to suggest destinations or says they have no fixed destination; otherwise false.

Set has_female_traveler and has_kids from family composition as soon as known. NEVER ask for menstrual, period, fertility, or cycle information; it is not part of Wayfinder trip intake. School calendar details are optional: if the customer says the child is on holiday during the candidate travel period, accept that and do not ask for exact term dates. all_adults_leave_confirmed is true once every working adult's leave was named specifically for them.

Capture every named candidate destination in destination_options when the customer asks to compare or is considering several places. Do not force them to select one before comparing. A destination shortlist is sufficient to perform a comparison; destination_hint is reserved for the destination they eventually choose.

When every working adult's leave dates are stated, derive the overlapping available date range and put that overlap in travel_window. Do not ask for a separate travel window if it can be calculated from the named leave dates. If a date range is only a candidate window rather than confirmed trip dates, say so in summary.

List only information genuinely needed for the NEXT useful action in missing_info. Comparing destinations can proceed with a shortlist, family composition and candidate date window even if the origin city is not yet known; if origin is unknown, qualify travel-time comparisons and ask for the departure city after giving useful initial comparison. Ask one focused question at a time. Never make the customer repeat information already stated.

    `vertical_id == 'wayfinder'` branch calls just this one function and

    other branch in that file's if/elif chain already follows.

    `chat_id` is whatever WhatsApp hands this conversation as its id - for
    a "@lid" contact (confirmed - see mesh/lib/identity.py - carries no
    relation to the real phone number), an opaque id, not a dialable
    number. Every customer-data operation below runs against
    `identity_key`, not `chat_id` directly: once this contact has
    confirmed a real phone number through the upload page's mandatory
    field, THAT number is the one piece of durable identity Wayfinder
    actually links everything by - chat history, documents, profile -
    never the WhatsApp id itself, which is only ever used to look the
    confirmed number back up.

    Deliberately NOT the same thing as checking CustomerSnapshot.missing_
    info for a document-shaped phrase (LLM free text is too unreliable
    to branch control flow on) - whether to send the upload link is
    decided from the one fact that's actually deterministic: does this
    customer have zero successfully-read documents on file yet.
    Once documents exist, the LLM-inferred missing_info list (preferences,
    family/leave info) is what drives the next question - that's fine
    there because it's being shown to the customer as a prompt, not
    branched on in code.

    `upload_instruction`: overrides every "here's a link" reply below with
    this exact text instead, and skips minting an upload_links token
    entirely - for a caller (wayfinder_web.py) that already has its own
    in-page upload control, so a separate browser link would be
    redundant. None (the default, what WhatsApp's own caller uses) keeps
    the original link-minting behavior unchanged.
