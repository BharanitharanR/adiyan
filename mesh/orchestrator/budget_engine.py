"""
Deterministic trip-affordability engine, adapted from a standalone prototype
the user built and handed over for review (deterministic_travel_budget_
engine.zip - an HDFC-only PDF parser + classifier + budget formula). That
prototype's own test run against a real statement left 93% of debits
UNKNOWN (see its sample_statement_analysis.json: ~INR 33.9L of ~36.5L in
debits), and its parser only understands one bank's exact PDF text layout -
neither is good enough to plug in as-is.

The fix keeps the prototype's actually-good part (budget.py's formula -
pure arithmetic, reconciliation-checked, no LLM) and replaces its weak
part (a bank-specific regex parser) with the one thing this project
already has that's bank-agnostic: Muse Spark, which already turned the
PDF into clean markdown (mesh.lib.meta_model_client.extract_document_text,
called from upload_links.py). normalize_transactions() below is the one
LLM call in this whole pipeline - a single schema-constrained extraction
turning that markdown into a strict transaction list, not a second
freehand read. Classification, aggregation, and the budget formula itself
are the ported prototype's own deterministic code, unchanged in spirit:
same keyword-rule-first-match-wins classifier, same "unknown debits are
never silently essential/discretionary" rule, same available_savings +
future_savings formula.

This module does NOT attempt the full available_savings/future_savings
trip-budget figure yet - that needs current_balance, emergency_reserve,
upcoming_obligations, and months_until_departure, none of which Wayfinder
collects from the customer today. compute_financial_profile() stops at a
grounded, auditable income/expense/surplus read (what budget_signal
needed to stop being free LLM prose) and flags low-confidence profiles
plainly rather than feeding a shaky number into a formula anyway.
