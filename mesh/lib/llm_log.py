"""
One central, plain-text log of every prompt any agent sends to the LLM and
the response it got back - mesh/lib/agent_sdk.py's ask() is the single
chokepoint every agent's LLM call already goes through (see that module's
own docstring), so this is the one place that needs wiring, the same
platform-hook precedent Phase 5's memory wiring already established there.

~/.Adiyan/logs/llm_calls.log, not each agent's own $LOG_DIR/<agent>.log -
the whole point is being able to read one file and see every agent's LLM
traffic in call order, not grep across twenty separate per-agent logs that
only hold whatever that one process happened to print. Every agent process
appends to this same file independently (there's no single process that
could hold a shared Python logger object across them) - plain `open(...,
'a')` appends are atomic on POSIX for writes this size, so concurrent
agents interleaving into one file is safe without a lock.

Deliberately outside mesh/lib/agent_sdk.py itself - a separate module
because "how do I log an LLM call" and "how do I make an LLM call" are
different concerns, the same separation mesh/lib/memory_hook.py already
keeps from mesh/lib/graph_store.py.
